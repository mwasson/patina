Patina is a small NES emulator; development began by Mike Wasson in March
2025. The original goals of the project were:

- to learn Rust,
- explore the limits of how an LLM could be used to assist in software development
- create an NES emulator that can run the original Super Mario Bros.

While the LLM Claude was used in early stages of development to explore
what was possible, code was always my own words and typed in myself.
